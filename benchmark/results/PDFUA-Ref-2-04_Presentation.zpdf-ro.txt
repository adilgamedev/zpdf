Main rules:
■All elements must be tagged, semantically appropriate  
■The logical reading order (order of tags) must be defined  
■All non text elements need text alternatives (description)  
More rules, e.g.:
■All glyphs Unicode (€ ✓ ≠)  
■Document title defined and shown

How to get Tagged / accessible PDF?
■Use the right tools  
*
■Basic knowledge for all participants (see pdfa.org   )
■I recommend: Don´t tag a PDF after it is generated
