How to get Tagged / accessible PDF?
 ■Use the right tools ■Basic knowledge for all participants (see pdfa.org*
)
 ■I recommend: Don´t tag a PDF after it is generated* E.g. Tagged PDF Best Practice Guide: Syntax, https://www.pdfa.org/resource/tagged-pdf-best-practice-guide-syntax/DocEng 2019: More than just digital paper – hidden features of the PDF format
